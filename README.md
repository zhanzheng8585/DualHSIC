Codebase for ICML 2023 submission: DualHSIC: HSIC-Bottleneck and Alignment for Continual Learning

Based on [https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth](Mammoth)

The command for reproducing the results on Split CIFAR-100 with DualHSIC + DER++:
```
bash scripts/DualHSIC_derpp.sh
```
The arguments are self-explanatory and correspond to hyperparameter settings presented in our paper.

A clean version with more scripts will be released upon acceptance.
